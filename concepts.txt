1. Virtual DOM vs real DOM, what is diffing algorithm and reconciliation, why does React use virtual DOM?

Real DOM is the structural representation of all the nodes in a HTML document.
Vitual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM.
Diffing algorithm is used to find  the differences between the real DOM and the virtual DOM.
Reconciliation is the process where these differences are reconciled by updating the real DOM.
Virtual DOM is lightweight and fast.

2. React lifecycle methods, 3 stages, how and why do we use them

Mounting: constructor() -> getDerivedStateFromProps() -> render() -> componentDidMount()
Updating: getDerivedStateFromProps() -> shouldComponentUpdate() -> render() -> getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() -> componentDidUpdate()
Unmounting: componentWillUnmount()

componentDidMount():
    This method is called after the component has been rendered for the first time.
    We can fetch data here.
shouldComponentUpdate():
    This method is called before the rendering but after the state change.
    We use it to determine whether or not to re-render
componentDidUpdate():
    This method is called after the re-rendering.
    We can fetch additional data here which are only required because of some specific udpates.
componentWillUnmount():
    This method is called beofore the component is removed.
    We can do some analytics or clean-up here.

3. The purpose of using the key attribute when we use map in JSX

The key attribute allows React to differentiate among the same HTML elements in a list
so that React can better update the list.

4. Ways of triggering component update

state changes, props changes, parent component updates, forceUpdate() calls

5. What is HOC and higher order function?

HOC is a function that takes a component has a parameter, wraps that component inside an outer component,
and returns the outer component.
HOF is a function that takes a function as an argument, wraps that function, and returns the wrapped function.

6. What/why custom hooks?

A custom hook is a hook defined by the developers themselves according to the specific needs of the program.
A custom hook usually contains some logics reusuable across different components.

7. What is the “children” props?

The "children" props are the chilren (nested) components of a component.

8. what/why React.memo, useMemo, useCallback

React.memo is a HOC.
We use React.memo to do memoization and avoid unnecessary rerendering.

useMemo is a hook.
We use it to do memoization for the outputs of function calls in functional components.

useCallback is a hook.
We use it to do memoize the reference to a function.
